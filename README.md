# Deploy Client

The default client is publicly hosted by me on Azure here:

However, you can deploy your own client with a single button press to Azure by clicking here:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fkevinl95%2FRefurboard%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json)

## Why Deploy your own client?

Many schools have complicated rules governing external resources teachers can access. Deploying your own Refurboard client makes it simple to whitelist the address of the client so that teachers can access the tool more easily.
