Using just a webcam and an IR pen, teachers can write, draw, and interact directly on their projected lessons. Why Refurboard? Many schools have projectors but can't afford expensive interactive whiteboard systems. Refurboard provides the same functionality using equipment you likely already have: Free and open source - no licensing fees, ever Works with existing projectors - no need to replace hardware Simple setup - get started in minutes Cross-platform - runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux What You'll Need Item What to Look For IR Pen Any infrared stylus with a button (Wii-era whiteboard pens work great and are inexpensive) Camera A webcam that can see infrared light, OR use your smartphone as a webcam with apps like Camo, EpocCam, or DroidCam Computer Windows, Mac, or Linux - connected to your projector Projector/Display Your existing classroom projector or large display IR pass filter A lens you can place over your camera lens to only let IR light through. Tips for Cameras You'll need a camera that can see infrared light. The easiest option is to add an IR pass filter over the lens - these are inexpensive and readily available (search for \"IR pass filter\" or \"infrared cold mirror\" sized for your camera lens). Using your phone as a webcam? These options work well: Android 14+ - Built-in webcam mode (Settings > Connected devices > USB > Webcam) Camo (iPhone & Android) - very reliable EpocCam (iPhone & Android) - simple to use DroidCam (Android) - budget-friendly option Tip: Use a USB cable instead of Wi-Fi for the most responsive experience. Getting Started Step 1: Download Refurboard Download the latest version for your operating system from the Releases page . Windows: Download the .exe file Mac: Download the .app file Linux: Download the Linux binary Mac Users: First-Time Setup Since Refurboard isn't from the Mac App Store, your Mac will show a security warning the first time you open it. Here's how to allow it: Right-click (or Control-click) on Refurboard.app Select Open from the menu Click Open in the warning dialog That's it! The app will now open normally every time If you already tried to open it and got blocked: Open System Settings > Privacy & Security Scroll down to find the message about Refurboard Click Open Anyway Grant Camera Permission: When you first select a camera, macOS will ask for permission. Click OK to allow access. If no cameras appear in the dropdown: Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera Find Refurboard in the list and enable it Restart Refurboard Grant Accessibility Permission (required for cursor control): Refurboard needs permission to move your cursor. macOS won't prompt for this automatically \u2014 you must grant it manually: Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility Click the + button Navigate to and select Refurboard.app Make sure the toggle is turned on If cursor tracking shows in Refurboard but your cursor doesn't move, this permission is missing. Step 2: Position Your Camera Set up your camera so it can see the entire projected area : Mount it on a tripod, shelf, or use a phone clamp Make sure all four corners of your display are visible The camera should be stable (not handheld) Step 3: Launch and Calibrate Open Refurboard - a small control panel appears Select your camera from the dropdown menu Click \"Start Calibration\" - a fullscreen window opens with four targets Touch each target with your IR pen - hold steady until it locks (about 1 second each) Done! Your pen now controls the cursor Step 4: Start Teaching!

Software Stack Python 3.11+ managed by Poetry. OpenCV + NumPy for capture, blob analysis, and homography math. Dear PyGui for the main control column (420 px wide, stacked widgets). Pointer drivers : ydotool on Linux/Wayland (needs uinput); pynput/XTest on X11; SendInput on Windows; Quartz CGEvent on macOS. PyInstaller for single-file binaries. Architecture Overview Refurboard uses OpenCV-based IR blob detection with adaptive brightness gating. The system: Captures frames from any UVC-compatible camera (USB webcam or phone-as-webcam). Detects IR blobs above a learned intensity threshold. Maps blob coordinates through a 3\u00d73 homography matrix to screen coordinates. Drives the system cursor via platform-specific pointer backends. The Dear PyGui control surface is intentionally tall and narrow for lecterns and portrait displays. The fullscreen calibration viewport uses pure OpenCV (no nested toolkits, no window chrome) for consistent behavior across platforms. Dear PyGui Layout (Columnar UI) The app window vertical stack contains: Logo header - uses the PNG assets in /assets for brand consistency. Camera picker - dropdown listing USB/phone webcams plus a refresh button. Sensitivity sliders - IR gain and click hysteresis with safe defaults but adjustable live. Calibration button - launches the fullscreen OpenCV viewport on the active display. Accuracy summary - RMS reprojection error displayed after calibration. Live preview - shows the camera feed with detected IR blobs highlighted. Configuration File Stored via PlatformDirs (e.g., ~/.local/share/Refurboard/refurboard.config.json on Linux). Contains the active camera ID; detection knobs (sensitivity, hysteresis, smoothing, jitter deadzone min_move_px ); and the latest calibration quadrilateral plus monitor name/index and origin. Safe to edit between sessions; the UI writes whenever you tweak sliders or complete calibration. Installation from Source # Clone repository git clone https://github.com/kevinl95/Refurboard.git cd Refurboard # Install dependencies poetry install # Launch the control surface poetry run refurboard Poetry downloads all runtime dependencies (OpenCV, Dear PyGui, pynput, etc.) and exposes a console script named refurboard . Linux Pointer Control (Wayland/X11) X11 Works out of the box via pynput/XTest. No additional setup required. Wayland Install ydotool and ensure uinput access: 1. Add user to input group: sudo usermod -aG input $USER # Log out and back in for this to take effect 2. Create udev rule for uinput access: sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-uinput.rules >/dev/null <<'EOF' KERNEL==\"uinput\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", TAG+=\"uaccess\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" EOF sudo udevadm control --reload-rules sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=misc --attr-match=name=uinput sudo modprobe uinput 3.

Refurboard drives the cursor through this socket on Wayland. macOS Gatekeeper Since Refurboard is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it by default. Users have three options: Method 1: Right-click to Open (recommended for end users) 1. Right-click (or Control-click) on Refurboard.app 2. Select Open from the context menu 3. Click Open in the warning dialog Method 2: System Settings 1. Try to open the app (it will be blocked) 2. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security 3. Find the message about Refurboard being blocked and click Open Anyway Method 3: Terminal (for IT deployment) # Remove the quarantine attribute xattr -cr /path/to/Refurboard.app After any method, macOS will remember the choice and the app opens normally in the future. Testing & Packaging poetry run pytest # run unit tests poetry run pyinstaller --clean refurboard.spec # build single-file binary GitHub Actions run tests plus PyInstaller builds on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. The spec bundles OpenCV libs, logo assets, and Quartz modules on macOS. Advanced Troubleshooting Symptom Fix Cursor wobbles Increase smoothing or min_move_px in config; reduce camera gain; ensure tripod stability. Clicks misfire Raise sensitivity or hysteresis so weak reflections keep the click gate open. Calibration error > 10 px Re-run calibration after re-aiming the camera; ensure camera sees every corner and minimize bright IR reflections. Pointer on wrong monitor Re-run calibration on the intended display; the app remembers that monitor. Wayland: cursor does not move Ensure ydotoold user service is running and /run/user/$(id -u)/.ydotool_socket exists; add user to input , apply the udev rule for /dev/uinput , reload uinput . macOS: \"unidentified developer\" Right-click the app > Open > Open, or use xattr -cr Refurboard.app in Terminal.
