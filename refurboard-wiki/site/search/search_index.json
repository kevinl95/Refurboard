Using just a webcam and an IR pen, teachers can write, draw, and interact directly on their projected lessons. Why Refurboard? Many schools have projectors but can't afford expensive interactive whiteboard systems. Refurboard provides the same functionality using equipment you likely already have: Free and open source - no licensing fees, ever Works with existing projectors - no need to replace hardware Simple setup - get started in minutes Cross-platform - runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux What You'll Need Item What to Look For IR Pen Any infrared stylus with a button (Wii-era whiteboard pens work great and are inexpensive) Camera A webcam that can see infrared light, OR use your smartphone as a webcam with apps like Camo, EpocCam, or DroidCam Computer Windows, Mac, or Linux - connected to your projector Projector/Display Your existing classroom projector or large display IR pass filter A lens you can place over your camera lens to only let IR light through. Tips for Cameras You'll need a camera that can see infrared light. The easiest option is to add an IR pass filter over the lens - these are inexpensive and readily available (search for \"IR pass filter\" or \"infrared cold mirror\" sized for your camera lens). Using your phone as a webcam? These options work well: Android 14+ - Built-in webcam mode (Settings > Connected devices > USB > Webcam) Camo (iPhone & Android) - very reliable EpocCam (iPhone & Android) - simple to use DroidCam (Android) - budget-friendly option Tip: Use a USB cable instead of Wi-Fi for the most responsive experience. Getting Started Step 1: Download Refurboard Download the latest version for your operating system from the Releases page . Windows: Download the .exe file Mac: Download the .app file Linux: Download the Linux binary Step 2: Position Your Camera Set up your camera so it can see the entire projected area : Mount it on a tripod, shelf, or use a phone clamp Make sure all four corners of your display are visible The camera should be stable (not handheld) Step 3: Launch and Calibrate Open Refurboard - a small control panel appears Select your camera from the dropdown menu Click \"Start Calibration\" - a fullscreen window opens with four targets Touch each target with your IR pen - hold steady until it locks (about 1 second each) Done! Your pen now controls the cursor Step 4: Start Teaching! Your IR pen now works like a mouse: Touch the screen = Click Touch and drag = Draw or highlight Use with any software: PowerPoint, Google Slides, whiteboard apps, web browsers, and more! Quick Troubleshooting Problem Solution Pen not detected Make sure your IR pen's battery is charged and the button is pressed Cursor jumps around Reduce ambient light or adjust the sensitivity slider Wrong screen Re-run calibration on the correct display Camera not found Check USB connection; try a different port Classroom Ideas Interactive Lessons - Annotate slides, diagrams, and documents in real-time Student Participation - Pass the pen to students for board work Educational Games - Play interactive learning games on the big screen Art Projects - Digital drawing and collaborative artwork Math Practice - Work through problems step-by-step with the class Need More Help?

Software Stack Python 3.11+ managed by Poetry. OpenCV + NumPy for capture, blob analysis, and homography math. Dear PyGui for the main control column (420 px wide, stacked widgets). Pointer drivers : ydotool on Linux/Wayland (needs uinput); pynput/XTest on X11; SendInput on Windows; Quartz CGEvent on macOS. PyInstaller for single-file binaries. Architecture Overview Refurboard uses OpenCV-based IR blob detection with adaptive brightness gating. The system: Captures frames from any UVC-compatible camera (USB webcam or phone-as-webcam). Detects IR blobs above a learned intensity threshold. Maps blob coordinates through a 3\u00d73 homography matrix to screen coordinates. Drives the system cursor via platform-specific pointer backends. The Dear PyGui control surface is intentionally tall and narrow for lecterns and portrait displays. The fullscreen calibration viewport uses pure OpenCV (no nested toolkits, no window chrome) for consistent behavior across platforms. Dear PyGui Layout (Columnar UI) The app window vertical stack contains: Logo header - uses the PNG assets in /assets for brand consistency. Camera picker - dropdown listing USB/phone webcams plus a refresh button. Sensitivity sliders - IR gain and click hysteresis with safe defaults but adjustable live. Calibration button - launches the fullscreen OpenCV viewport on the active display. Accuracy summary - RMS reprojection error displayed after calibration. Live preview - shows the camera feed with detected IR blobs highlighted. Configuration File Stored via PlatformDirs (e.g., ~/.local/share/Refurboard/refurboard.config.json on Linux). Contains the active camera ID; detection knobs (sensitivity, hysteresis, smoothing, jitter deadzone min_move_px ); and the latest calibration quadrilateral plus monitor name/index and origin. Safe to edit between sessions; the UI writes whenever you tweak sliders or complete calibration. Installation from Source # Clone repository git clone https://github.com/kevinl95/Refurboard.git cd Refurboard # Install dependencies poetry install # Launch the control surface poetry run refurboard Poetry downloads all runtime dependencies (OpenCV, Dear PyGui, pynput, etc.) and exposes a console script named refurboard . Linux Pointer Control (Wayland/X11) X11 Works out of the box via pynput/XTest. No additional setup required. Wayland Install ydotool and ensure uinput access: 1. Add user to input group: sudo usermod -aG input $USER # Log out and back in for this to take effect 2. Create udev rule for uinput access: sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-uinput.rules >/dev/null <<'EOF' KERNEL==\"uinput\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"input\", TAG+=\"uaccess\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" EOF sudo udevadm control --reload-rules sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=misc --attr-match=name=uinput sudo modprobe uinput 3. Run ydotoold as a user service: mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/ydotool.service <<'EOF' [Unit] Description=ydotoold (user) After=graphical-session.target [Service] Type=simple Environment=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/%U ExecStart=/usr/bin/ydotoold --socket-path /run/user/%U/.ydotool_socket Restart=on-failure [Install] WantedBy=default.target EOF systemctl --user daemon-reload systemctl --user enable --now ydotool.service Verify /run/user/$(id -u)/.ydotool_socket exists. Refurboard drives the cursor through this socket on Wayland. Testing & Packaging poetry run pytest # run unit tests poetry run pyinstaller --clean refurboard.spec # build single-file binary GitHub Actions run tests plus PyInstaller builds on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. The spec bundles OpenCV libs, logo assets, and Quartz modules on macOS. Advanced Troubleshooting Symptom Fix Cursor wobbles Increase smoothing or min_move_px in config; reduce camera gain; ensure tripod stability. Clicks misfire Raise sensitivity or hysteresis so weak reflections keep the click gate open. Calibration error > 10 px Re-run calibration after re-aiming the camera; ensure camera sees every corner and minimize bright IR reflections. Pointer on wrong monitor Re-run calibration on the intended display; the app remembers that monitor. Wayland: cursor does not move Ensure ydotoold user service is running and /run/user/$(id -u)/.ydotool_socket exists; add user to input , apply the udev rule for /dev/uinput , reload uinput .
