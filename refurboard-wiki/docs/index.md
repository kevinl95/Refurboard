## Give Your Classroom Projector Superpowers

**Refurboard transforms any projector or display into an interactive whiteboard** — no expensive hardware required! Using just a webcam and an IR pen, teachers can write, draw, and interact directly on their projected lessons.

## Why Refurboard?

Many schools have projectors but can't afford expensive interactive whiteboard systems. Refurboard provides the same functionality using equipment you likely already have:

- **Free and open source** — no licensing fees, ever
- **Works with existing projectors** — no need to replace hardware
- **Simple setup** — get started in minutes
- **Cross-platform** — runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## What You'll Need

| Item | What to Look For |
|------|------------------|
| **IR Pen** | Any infrared stylus with a button (Wii-era whiteboard pens work great and are inexpensive) |
| **Camera** | A webcam that can see infrared light, OR use your smartphone as a webcam with apps like Camo, EpocCam, or DroidCam |
| **Computer** | Windows, Mac, or Linux — connected to your projector |
| **Projector/Display** | Your existing classroom projector or large display |
| **IR pass filter** | A lens you can place over your camera lens to only let IR light through. |

### Tips for Cameras

You'll need a camera that can see infrared light. The easiest option is to add an **IR pass filter** over the lens — these are inexpensive and readily available (search for "IR pass filter" or "infrared cold mirror" sized for your camera lens).

**Using your phone as a webcam?** These options work well:

- **Android 14+** — Built-in webcam mode (Settings > Connected devices > USB > Webcam)
- **Camo** (iPhone & Android) — very reliable
- **EpocCam** (iPhone & Android) — simple to use  
- **DroidCam** (Android) — budget-friendly option

**Tip:** Use a USB cable instead of Wi-Fi for the most responsive experience.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download Refurboard

Download the latest version for your operating system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kevinl95/Refurboard/releases).

- **Windows:** Download the `.exe` file
- **Mac:** Download the `.app` file  
- **Linux:** Download the Linux binary

### Step 2: Position Your Camera

Set up your camera so it can see the **entire projected area**:

- Mount it on a tripod, shelf, or use a phone clamp
- Make sure all four corners of your display are visible
- The camera should be stable (not handheld)

### Step 3: Launch and Calibrate

1. **Open Refurboard** — a small control panel appears
2. **Select your camera** from the dropdown menu
3. **Click "Start Calibration"** — a fullscreen window opens with four targets
4. **Touch each target with your IR pen** — hold steady until it locks (about 1 second each)
5. **Done!** Your pen now controls the cursor

### Step 4: Start Teaching!

Your IR pen now works like a mouse:

- **Touch the screen** = Click
- **Touch and drag** = Draw or highlight
- Use with any software: PowerPoint, Google Slides, whiteboard apps, web browsers, and more!
