# Refurboard

## Welcome

Refurboard is an innovative, low-cost solution that turns your old smartphone into an interactive whiteboard for classrooms, businesses, and artists. By leveraging the camera on your device and utilizing computer vision to track LED pens (such as those purchasable at discount retailers, such as FiveBelow), Refurboard enables users to interact with projected displays in real time. Teachers, in particular, can greatly benefit from this tool, as it provides an affordable way to enhance classroom interactivity without requiring expensive equipment.

Client devices can be running any operating system as long as they can connect to the same network as your computer and have a camera. This means your old Android. iOS device, Windows Phone, and more can have a second life!

Refurboard's design focuses on simplicity and affordability, making it accessible to anyone. You can easily set it up by pointing your phone's camera at your projector screen, calibrating the boundaries, and using an LED pen to control the cursor. Once calibrated, the app tracks the pen's movements and moves the mouse cursor accordingly, creating an interactive whiteboard experience.

### Key Benefits:
- **Impact for Teachers**: Teachers can turn any old smartphone into an interactive tool for their classroom, enabling students to interact with lessons in real-time. This helps make learning more engaging and interactive without a big investment in hardware.
- **Low-Cost Setup**: You don't need expensive smartboards or interactive projectors. Refurboard uses affordable LED pens (available at discount stores like FiveBelow) and old smartphones, minimizing costs while still offering powerful functionality.
- **Simple Calibration**: Setting up Refurboard is easy. Point your phone at your projector screen, run the calibration process, and the app will learn the boundaries of the screen. The LED pen then becomes a pointer, and the app will track its movement, controlling the mouse cursor on your connected computer.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Refurboard works on a variety of devices, including Android, iOS, and Windows, so you can use it with devices you already own.
